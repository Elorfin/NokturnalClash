    Fascinated since childhood by the power of images, and the strength of the performances, I resolutely turn to the
    photography quite late in 2006 with the purchase of my first digital SLR. My first favorite themes
    are related to my other interests, and I quickly turn to concert photography, taste
    which will not fail over time. Over time, I developed my artistic practice, and am attracted to others
    themes, including architectural photography, which I appreciate the strong ability to immerse the viewer in
    a vast and exotic world ... but also by food photography, and more immediately evocative dimension!

<br/><br/>

    Since 2013, I also immersed in film photography, fascinated by the image of an approach to patience
    and precision. Child of digital, I still feel a strong respect for the original know-how; Stadium
    Next will be the installation of my laboratory to develop my own film and prints. By himself pure, as
    Everytime.

<br/><br/>

    Attracted by the underground circles, I like to hang my gaiters in all kinds of concerts, but also meet
    promising artstes, explore and discover their world, and their capacity building. So you will find,
    more galleries devoted to concert photography, various "live reports" and interviews in the section
    "Music" of this website.

<br/><br/>

    I try to do my photographic approach as my life, a coherent universe, where the visual resonates with
    meaning. I like to find an ecstatic expression on the face of an artist in concert, or enter a building by emphasizing its
    functionality or, conversely, its unique demonstration effect! some ir√©elles images yet taken of our world
    daily, or rather my travels as an invitation to always better observe the world around us,
    its many facets ...
